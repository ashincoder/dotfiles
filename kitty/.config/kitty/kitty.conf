#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators (see tab_powerline_style)
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/#select-tab action which presents you with a list
#:     of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used

tab_title_template "{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title. If you wish to include the tab-index as well, use something
#: like: {index}: {title}. Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for
#: goto_tab N. If you prefer to see the index as a superscript, use
#: {sup.index}. In addition you can use {layout_name} for the current
#: layout name, {num_windows} for the number of windows in the tab and
#: {num_window_groups} for the number of window groups (not counting
#: overlay windows) in the tab. Note that formatting is done by
#: Python's string formatting machinery, so you can use, for instance,
#: {layout_name[:2].upper()} to show only the first two letters of the
#: layout name, upper-cased. If you want to style the text, you can
#: use styling directives, for example:
#: {fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.default}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}green
#: bg{fmt.bg.normal}. Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: {fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}.
